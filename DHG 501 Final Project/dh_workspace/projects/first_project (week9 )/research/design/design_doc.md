## Background and Context (the W's)

- Water is always an important natural resource that everyone needs in daily life. It was true that human lives are inseparable of water. Therefore, water and the ways for getting them were always the foundation of different civilizations starting from remote antiquity. However, after the medieval period, a large number of people gathered inside the city while more large-scale and well-developed cities existed all around the world, the demand for water in a small area increased rapidly. Not only water, different natural resources (like food supply) that naturally existed in cities were no longer able to support such a large population, so unprecedented human interventions such as developing pre-modern water supply systems must also be executed when pre-modern cities were developed. Among all these cities, Edo city was definitely one of most structured cities in the Japan as well as Asian region while this city played an extremely crucial role and supreme position in modern Japanese history no matter whether on social and political aspects. For instance, the name of Edo city represented the whole Tokugawa period even until nowadays, “Edo period” was also another synonym of Tokugawa period.

- In fact, the water supply system developed during the Edo period was also the prototype of the current Japan water supply system, so it was extremely important. At the same time, before the Tokugawa period, Japan was stuck in the warring states period (different clans and military powers were fighting one another) and the whole of Japan was reunited again in the Tokugawa period with less foreign influences (although the Sakoku policy declined in the late Tokugawa period, it still remained powerful in the beginning of Tokugawa period), so it was a special period. At the same time, some research pointed out that the water supply system was first modernised in this period, so the Edo water supply system had the meaning of going from zero to one, it is indeed the modern foundation.

- As mentioned in the above, I prefer to write an historical text related more about social and cultural context, so I would like to zoom in on commoners living in the Edo period (Although some sources mentioned that only relatively richer people and elites living in Edo could have the rights to use the water supply system). On the other hand, there were undoubtedly many different stakeholders participating in Edo water supply system, such as the governor, samurai and merchants. I believed that they were also the focusing groups in my project. In fact, the positions and powers inside the water supply system kept changing during the whole Edo period since the water supply system was linked to different historical events.

## Research Puzzles

- How to use water supply system related issues and historical events to analysis early Edo society (especially on cultural and social aspect)

## Methodology

- Primary source: the primary documents from 東京都水道歴史館
https://www.ro-da.jp/suidorekishida/map/list?josuiName=1&offset=0&limit=20

- Secondary sources: different scholar works analysing Edo water supply system (For, instance, Hatano Jun writings help us understand the breif picture of introducing the relationship between Edo water supply system and society)

## Expected Outputs
- By analysing some sources from different scholars, it was true that the water supply system did not cover every region in Edo city just like nowadays. Water is still a valuable natural resource even after building a large scale water supply system. On the other hand, different sources listed in the reference list pointed out that there were two or more main body parts of the water system. These were the possible important points that I might further elaborate in my project

## Working hypotheses

- In current discovery, the water supply system was deeply connected to Edo's daily life including privileged samurai groups and general merchants. Of course, not all the citizens living in Edo city can enjoy the benefits from the water supply system (especially for the poor people).

## Challenges and Risks

1. At this moment, I found primary sources describing the water supply system in Edo City (maps describing different water systems in Edo city detailly). However, they were focusing on the late Edo period or even early Meiji period. The timeslot that I originally wanted to focus on was absent. Therefore, except for 東京都水道歴史館 website, I might need to find more primary sources from internet that could better suit the timeslot of my research topic. If the primary sources were absent, I need to slightly adjust my research focusing timeslot to late edo period. 

2. It is also very difficult to find out the exact location of the water supply system, some sources just show the brief area. I need to spend more time on tracking the original primary sources that paraphrased in different primary sources. 

## Action Items

- Important primary sources have been found from 東京都水道歴史館 website, so I need to further analysis them (Discovering how to use these information in my project)
- Trying to find more primary sources (such as government records…)
- Seeking more opinions and descriptions about Edo water supply system from different secondary sources
- Finding any other possible maps in Edo period (they might be useful for further analysis)
